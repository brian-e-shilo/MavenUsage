**Introduction**

Maven is a powerful build automation tool primarily used for Java projects. It simplifies project management by handling dependencies, builds, and documentation through a project object model (POM). This assignment demonstrates the fundamental concepts of Maven and its integration within the Eclipse IDE, including dependency management and build processes.

**Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Eclipse IDE**: Latest version recommended
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or above
- **Apache Maven**: Version 3.6.3 or above

I attached the complete pdf, which is also the same file that I had submitted as an assignment for my college earlier this year. It illustrates everything in detail

Hope you find it helpful!
